4 x 12 Handwired Ortholinear keyboard:
--------------------------------------

Layout:
-------

key considerations:
  - Modifier keys (space, enter, backspace, ...) should remain at the same locatins across all layers,
    this feels more natural since those keys are pressed the most, and usually apply to all groups.
    
  - Some common mapping should remain the same. 
    for example: symbols assoviated with numbers should remain the same,
    what ever the numbers layout we choose, keep 1 and ! on the same key.
    
  - Try to keep to the same form, for example, if arrows are:
          up
    left down right

    try not to change them for example to:

    left down up right
    
  - If a layout is much more efficient, it's worth the trouble of getting used to.
    for example: numpad VS numbers row.
