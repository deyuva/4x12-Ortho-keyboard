4 x 12 Handwired Ortholinear keyboard Guide:
--------------------------------------------


Layout:
-------

key considerations:
  - Modifier keys (space, enter, backspace, ...) should remain at the same locatins across all layers,
    this feels more natural since those keys are pressed the most, and usually apply to all groups -
    spaces for text or spaces for numbers.
  - Some common mapping should remain the same, we do not have to chage anything, will just make it harder to remember.
    for example: symbols assoviated with numbers should remain the same, what ever numbers layout we choose, we should keep
    1 and ! on the same key.
  - try to keep to the same form, for example, if arrows are:
          up
    left down right

    try not to change them for example to:

    left down up right

    keep in mind that if the layout is much better it might be worth to learn and change -
    i.e numpad VS numbers row.
