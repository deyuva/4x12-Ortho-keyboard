4 x 12 Handwired Ortholinear keyboard:
--------------------------------------

Layout:
-------

key considerations:
  - Modifier keys (space, enter, backspace, etc...) should remain at the same locations across all layers.
    
  - Some common mapping should remain the same. 
    for example: symbols assoviated with numbers should remain the same,
    what ever the numbers layout we choose, keep 1 and ! on the same key.
    
  - Try to keep to the same form, for example, if arrows are:
          up
    left down right

    try not to change them for example to:

    left down up right
    
  - If a layout is much more efficient, it's worth the trouble of getting used to.
    for example: numpad VS numbers row.
